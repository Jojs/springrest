#  REST
[Spring Data REST](http://docs.spring.io/spring-data/rest/docs/current/reference/html/) is goddamn cool!  
It has never been easier to create an application. Most repositories requires nothing more of you than declaring an interface.
With that you instantly have a data structure that can be exposed via REST and easily navigated.  
With this a very simple base-model can be create for AngularJS or any other code solution used for integration. 
See [Domain Model](src/main/resources/static/js/genericDomain.js)  

I'm far from finished exploring Spring Data REST but so far I like what I see.
