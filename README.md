Exploring basic rest service with Spring

##Project Purpose
2016-03-20, 11.30  
Almost every project I ever worked on were already years old, save for a few handfull of mobile apps. Here I will explore how to start from scratch. In coming projecs I will see how to harness the solution to enterprise scale.
Why choose Spring and rest? What do you do when entering unknown teritory? - I call a friend :-) And he said "Springboot and rest", and sure enough there are lots of examples to find online. 
I use Spring for production and enterprise today. However, I have a little larger requirements to the final solution than this initial experiment will deliver, and that means building on top of this with other frameworks.
